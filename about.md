## Ards' Swimming Club
### *Swim Ireland Club of the Year!!*

We are a competitive Swimming Club based in Newtownards Leisure Centre, Northern Ireland. The Club caters for beginner-level swimmers from age six, to competitive swimmers at Senior and Master's level. 

A worthy achievement of note is that we are the only swimming club in Ireland to have had swimmers on both the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games Squad, and the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games Squads.
